title: "TIMBERHAUS: Climate-smart solutions for use of wood in the construction sector"
---
TIMBERHAUS, led by the Danish Technological Institute, is a Horizon Europe research and innovation project aiming to promote sustainable timber construction as a strategy for reducing the environmental impact of construction. The constriction sector is responsible for 40 per cent of carbon emissions, 50 per cent of all extracted materials, and 35 per cent of waste generated globally. Although wood is a promising substitute due to its carbon-storing properties, current wood processing technologies and supply chains are not yet equipped to handle a diverse range of wood types, including hardwood and recycled wood. Ensuring the sustainability of the timber supply is also essential in a changing climate that is affecting the health of our forests.

The project is a collaboration between 19 partners from city governments, research institutes, universities, and architectects. Starting in November 2024, the consortium will pioneer sustainable wood solutions in construction through prototypes and analyses in three partner cities.

Our research contribution is to develop systems dynamics models of the wood construction value chain, and develop and implement participatory serious game models to explore opportunities and pathways for novel use of timber in construction.
