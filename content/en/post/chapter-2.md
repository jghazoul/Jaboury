title: "Soil Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Restored Landscapes"
---
Globally, forest restoration is promoted as a means of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by storing carbon in new forests. The Scottish Government has a policy to substantially increase woodland cover in part motivated by its ambitious 2045 net-zero carbon target. New woodlands are consequently being established in the Scottish Highlands, yet these uplands have extensive organic-rich soils that already store 1.7 billion tonnes of carbon. 

This project will explore how new woodlands on organic-rich soils in Scotland affect soil microbial communities and greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) emissions through the mineralisation of stored organic matter.
