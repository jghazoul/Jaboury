title: "Cross-scale plant-pollinator network dynamics"
---
This project aims to understand the effect of land use change in shaping the structure of plant-pollinator interaction networks in the coffee agroforestry of India. Using a combination of advanced landscape mapping, observational studies, pollen metabarcoding, and eDNA approaches, we aim to understand how the plant-pollinator network dynamics are affected by local and landscape level transitions in the land use. Also, the plausible causal pathways affecting the structure of plant pollinator interaction networks are assessed. The outcomes of this work can inform better land management strategies to restore biodiversity, ecosystem productivity and resilience, and sustainable agricultural production.
